<div class="paragraph">
<p>
  A mother is a caretaker, a divine entity of love and protection, and ultimately, for many,
  a mother is a space of comfort. Though we often dream that a space is a physical
  and tangible thing, we forget that a space is simply that which we find ourselves in or around.
  Mother, through the lens of grottesca, is the journey of taking care of others,
  being cared for, raising children, struggling for equity, and many other issues that women face.
  But being a mother isn't solely a human enterprise, mothers have existed for time immemorial
  across nearly all species. For this entry though we will focus on
  the experience of the human mother.
  </p>
  <p>
  Throughout the world woman face oppression and misogyny in many forms. 
  A particular case is that of pregnant woman in the USA, mothers to be if you will,
  will often find themselves stuck in an unforgiving position, they must either work til they are nearly due,
  or they must quit their jobs so that their pregnancy can come to term without any issues.
  Women that choose to stay at their jobs until they are due are then only given, on average, 29 days
  of paid maternity leave. In many other countries maternity leave spans months long periods
  while also paying the mother's significant amounts so that they can help support their families
  financially while still being able to stay home and take care of their babies.
  </p>
  <p>
  Besides the lack of support and outright oppression, that is ultimately rooted in misogyny, there are
  also many complications that come with being pregnant, and being a mother. Infant mortality rates in many
  countries have lowered over the last century because of medical and technological advancements. But these
  medical/technological have not been shared in the capacity that they should be. In many Asian and Sub Saharan
  countries infant mortality rates remain high despite the impressive steps that have been taken elsewhere
  in regard to infant mortality. This is not any fault of their own, rather it is the result of a capitalistic
  system putting profits and exploitation above the wellbeing of people. These high infant mortality rates
  disproportionately effect women, whether it be through the physical effects that come as a result from being
  pregnant or the mental anguish of your child dying.
  </p>
  <p>
  Yet mothers are still treated as if their position in the
  world/society is solely to care for children and their husbands. The respect that they deserve is never shown.
  But mothers are the ones who hold up society in many ways. Without mothers, children, generally speaking, would
  have less compassion and empathy, they would receive unsuitable care from fathers who oftentimes are not fit to
  raise children alone. Although these are obviously generalizations and are largerly based off of "traditional
  western gender roles" they are also quite commonly the reality that exists.
  </p>
  <p>
  Mothers are our protectors, they hold us together when we're so close to falling apart. They bring us back from
  the edge when it feels as if we may fall off. Mothers are a space that is warm and comfortable, a pair of arms
  wrapping around you in the times you need them the most.
  </p>
  <p class="end">
  mother, is a dedication to the role that mothers play in this world, their importance can not simply be forgotten
  or ignored, mothers truly hold us up and together, and I am thankful every day for my own mother and the role she
  plays in my life.
