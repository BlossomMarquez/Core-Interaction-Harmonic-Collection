    <figcaption>The Cryptorg controls Iterative Time Decay, which leads to the slow death of the future.
        We can understand time as a space, in which we all exist. Through this exploration of space we find
        our core functions. We age from baby, to teenager, to adult, to elderly. But culture does not follow
        this distinct trend, instead it follows a series of non-sequential cycles. From my own examinations
        of culture en masse we are in a cycle of pure repetition through simulacra. This repetitious cycle is
        leading us to the slow death of the future. This sequence is what I have termed to be Iterative Time Decay.
        Through iterative sequences time causes cultural decay when culture is left to be decided by capital interests.
        Subversive culture is co-opted by capitalist interests so that which once could be considered counter culture
        becomes completely mainstream and meaningless. It loses its edge, culture repeats itself and whatever is most
        pallatable remains and is repeated ad nauseum. We must fight back against this cultural decay, we must fight
        back against the constant cultural and social malaise that ails us so, against the monotony of our daily lives. grottesca explores my ideology through
        the lens of space, space is so much more than we can ever imagine it to be.
