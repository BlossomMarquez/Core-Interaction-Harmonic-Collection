  <div class="paragraph"><p>grottesca is a collection of images, videos, 3d scans, and written observations documenting
    the journey to and from a space, the experience inside this space, and the found objects at or around the space.
    this project is an exploration of the definition of space, space can be defined
    in a multitude of ways. but what makes a space itself? is it the objects that are near it? the journey to and from the space?
    is it the space itself? or is it the people and objects that occupy the space?
    is it all of these? does one piece of this equation outweigh another?
    or is it the harmonic collection of parts combining as a whole to create an
    experience that is in essence an experiental form of gestalt.
